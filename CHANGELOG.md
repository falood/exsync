## [0.4.0] - 2024-04-06

Fix compilation warnings

Allow using file_system 1.0

Remove the need to use `ExSync.register_group_leader` since the functionality it
provided is no longer needed on newer Elixir/Erlang versions.

This also removes the `ExSync.Logger.Server` module but that is an internal
module that shouldn't have been accessed by user code.
